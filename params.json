{"name":"PrimeFX","tagline":"The much better prime number finder algorithm.","body":"# The PrimeFX Project\r\nThis project offers a better algorithm for finding primes, improving response time and efficiency. \r\nIt is a pet project, and has little real-world applications. This project is for others to build upon and understand.\r\n\r\n### The Algorithm\r\nPrime numbers greater than 3 always come from the 6m±1 expression. Using this fact, the algorithm checks first for the exceptions to this rule - 2 and 3. If it doesn't find them, it then applies the 6m±1 expression and confirms the range for their primeness. Confirming is also more efficient. Traditionally, prime number finders/sorters check the remainder of the input with all the natural numbers below it, save '1,' using a loop. What this algorithm does is check whether the numbers are prime are not in a similar way - but by decreasing the limit till which the loop runs each time. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @the42guy","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
